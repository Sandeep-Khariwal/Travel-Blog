<h1>India gate: History</h1>

<p>
    <div>
        This stupendous structure was constructed by the Imperial War Graves Commission aka IWCG, which was established in 1917 to build war memorials and graves for soldiers who lose their lives in the First World War. The memorial was designed by a famous English architect by the name Sir Edwin Lutyens and its foundation was laid by the Duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria, on 10 February 1921. After 10 long years, on February 12, 1931, Viceroy Lord Irwin inaugurated and dedicated this structure to the nation and its future generations. The names of over 13,000 soldiers who lost their lives during the war are also inscribed on the memorial.
</div>
<div>
    In the honor of soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, a new structure was added to the India Gate in 1972. Known as Amar Jawan Jyoti (which means the Flame of the Immortal Soldier), this was inaugurated by Indira Gandhi, who was the then PM of India.
</div>


   <h1>India Gate Architecture</h1> 
<div>
    Sir Edwin Lutyens, who designed the India Gate, was a leading war memorial architect and was also a member of IWGC. He built it as a secular memorial free of any religious association or cultural ornamentation. Also, Lutyens wanted the monument to be a classical one, so refused to incorporate any Asian motifs such as pointed arches. The architectural style of India Gate is that of a triumphal arch and is often compared with the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the Gateway of India in Mumbai, and the Arch of Constantine.
</div>
<div>
    Situated in the middle of a hexagonal complex, the structure is 42 meters tall and 9.1 meters wide. The whole structure is made using yellow and red sandstone which was brought in directly from Bharatpur.
</div>
<div>
    About 150 meters towards the east of the India Gate, there is a canopy that was built in 1936 as a tribute to former Emperor of India, King George V. There used to be a marble statue of George V, but it was removed due to opposition from some political parties after India's independence. Currently the statue is located in Delhi's Coronation Park.
</div>
<div>
    India Gate also houses a small structure called Amar Jawan Jyoti, which consists of a marble pedestal with a cenotaph on its top. The cenotaph has the words 'Amar Jawan' written on all four sides in golden letters and also has a reversed rifle, capped by a soldier helmet, installed on it. The structure is surrounded by permanently burning flames fueled by CNG on all the four sides.
</div>
<h1>Things to Do at India Gate</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Every evening, this imposing structure is lit up with spotlights, making it one of the top tourist attractions to visit in Delhi during nights.</li>
    <li>The huge lawns surrounding the gate are a favorite spot for people to enjoy basket picnics, play cricket or indulge in kite flying.</li>
    <li>The Children's Park located near the gate is a great place to spend some time with your kids.</li>
    <li>Rajpath, the boulevard on which the monument is located, is where many people, both young and old, come for early morning walks.</li>
    <li>Within a kilometer of India Gate, you will find Andhra Bhavan, one of the iconic restaurants in Delhi known for its lip-smacking traditional food.</li>
    <li>The Pandara Road Market, which is also located within walking distance of India Gate, is an amazing food market to experience Delhi's street food flavors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Lesser-known Facts about India Gate</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The names of the soldiers inscribed on India Gate include a female staff nurse who died during the war.</li>
        <li>It is said that the empty canopy behind the India Gate symbolizes the British retreat in India.</li>
        <li>Sir Edwin Lutyens also designed other important monuments in India including Viceroy House which is now known as the Rashtrapati Bhavan.</li>
